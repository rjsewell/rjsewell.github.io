#Spin squeezing & atomic magnetometry

The achievement of spin squeezing in an optical magnetometer. This was a long-standing goal in the field, and opens the possibility of using these techniques to improve state-of-the-art optical magnetometers.

#Quantum non-demolition measurement

the development of statistical tools for verifying quantum non-demolition measurements of material systems

#Generating & detecting entanglement

Novel application of quantum control techniques to feedback cooling of atomic spins, and quantum state engineering of entangled many-body spin states.

#Nonlinear quantum measurements

Ground breaking studies of nonlinear quantum measurements, including the first experiment showing sub-Heisenberg scaling of measurement sensitivity, and the first high-precision nonlinear quantum measurement. This is a new topic in quantum metrology, and our work has demonstrated not only that sub-Heisenberg scaling is possible, but that nonlinear interferometers can outperform linear ones for some classes of measurements.

#Matter-wave interferometry

Development of an atom-chip BEC interferometer during my PhD research. The goal of this work was to study interferometric measurements of small energy differences using BECs on an atom chip, and we made the first study of systematic errors as well as statistical noise in such a device, showing that it could, for example, be used to make precision measurements of atom surface-interactions.
