# A short career summary

I am currently Staff Academic Scientist and Coordinator of Academic Programs at [ICFO](http://www.icfo.es) - the Institute of Photonic Sciences in Barcelona, Spain. Prior to that I was a senior postdoctoral researcher in the group of  [Morgan Mitchell](http://www.icfo.eu/research/group_details.php?id=20) leading a research laboratory in experimental quantum optics, quantum metrology and optical magnetometry with laser cooled atoms. I gained my PhD [Imperial College London](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk) in the group of [Ed Hinds](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/ccm/), developing a matter wave interferometer using atom-chip technology.

I continue to work as a senior scientist running Morgan's cold atom research lab, as well as working with [Niek van Hulst](http://www.icfo.eu/about_icfo/people_ficha.php?people_id=95) to run ICFO's academic programs for our PhD and MSc students and undergraduate fellows.
