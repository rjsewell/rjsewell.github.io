I lead a research laboratory in experimental quantum optics, quantum metrology and optical magnetometry with laser cooled atoms. I gained my PhD [Imperial College London](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk) in the group of [Prof. Ed Hinds](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/ccm/), developing an atom-chip-based Bose-Einstein condensate interferometer.
