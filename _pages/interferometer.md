Development of an atom-chip BEC interferometer during my PhD research. The goal of this work was to study interferometric measurements of small energy differences using BECs on an atom chip, and we made the first study of systematic errors as well as statistical noise in such a device, showing that it could, for example, be used to make precision measurements of atom surface-interactions.
